# Homework 6

## Pythonic Monopoly

My name is Oscar Lopez, Iâ€™m a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp Program.

In this activity, I was task with building a prototype dashboard for a Real Estate team, the prototype will be a trial for an initial investment opportunity in the San Francisco market with the possibility of expanding to other markets. The dashboard will provide charts, maps, and interactive visualization to help customers explore data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties.

I used the skills learned in the class last week using PyViz to create bar charts, line charts, grouping charts using hvplot, creating a neighborhood map using my mapbox key, creating a parallel coordinate plot, a parallel categories plot and a sunburst plot.

With all the plots mentioned above, I build an interactive dashboard with tabs visualizing the housing units per year average, housing costs, average prices by neighborhood, the 10 most expensive neighborhoods, comparing cost to purchase versus rental income, and cost analysis.

In this assignment, I used class exercises and google to complete both start codes. I had challenges with the new plots that were not discussed in class, as well as writing the final code and serving the panel dashboard, I had help from class instructors to find a solution, was not able to get it 100% but was able to complete it
